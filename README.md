HTML, SCSS and JavaScript
The plan was to do CSS but thinking about switching to SCSS.
Yepp. Changed it.
- Responsiveness
- WCAG
- Correct HTML for each use
- Try to solve in:
    1. HTML
    2. SCSS
    3. JavaScript



To do:
- content
- fix footer color
- move click-eventlisteners from html too script.js
- utility classes, what's used and only that
- config.scss - everything?
- mobile.scss
- widescreen.scss
