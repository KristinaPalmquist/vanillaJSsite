HTML, SCSS and JavaScript
The plan was to do CSS but thinking about switching to SCSS.
Yepp. Changed it.

- Responsiveness
- WCAG
- Semantic HTML
- Try to solve in:
  1. HTML
  2. SCSS
  3. JavaScript

To do:

- content
- fix footer color
- move click-eventlisteners from html too script.js
- utility classes, what's used and only that
- config.scss - everything?
- mobile.scss
- widescreen.scss
- light / dark mode ?
- accessability
